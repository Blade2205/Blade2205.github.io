I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1 Part 1
I consider this lab one of the most fun labs because it's the start. It makes you learn about what you're getting into and gets you started. It is an extremely simple lab, but to me ended up being very enjoyable to start off.

Lab 7 Part 2
I enjoyed this part of the lab a lot because it made us use what we learned for real life application. This made me think about the possible uses that computer science could be used for and was cool to be able to find out at least one way our code can be useful.

Lab 11
This was honestly the lab I struggled in the most and required a lot of help. It was a real struggle to get this done, but it was very enjoyable and got me to realize that there is a lot for me to learn about computer science.
